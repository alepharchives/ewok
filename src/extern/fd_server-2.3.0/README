This is the fdsrv package from jungerl packaged as single
standalone package. To build:

# make 
# sudo make install

this install fdsrv inside the erlang found in the PATH
The intent of this package is that it should be much easier
for yaws folks to get fdsrv in the air. It needs to get installed
as root since it sets the suid bit on the fdsrv binary.




The fdserv.erl module makes it possible to open
up privileged ports from Erlang running as non-root.

Here is an example from the esmb_browser.erl code:
---------------------------------
...
{ok, Fd} = open_socket(137, []),
....

open_socket(Port,Opts) ->
    case fdsrv:bind_socket(udp, Port) of
	{ok, Fd} ->
	    gen_udp:open(Port, [{fd, Fd}, binary, {broadcast,true} | Opts]);
	Error ->
	    ?elog("Couldn't open socket, port=~p: ~p~n",[Port, Error])
    end. 
--------------------------------

Here we open the NetBIOS-NameService port 137.

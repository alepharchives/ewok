This folder contains AJAX script sources for ESP.
The AJAX javascripts depend on and are written to JQuery 1.3.2.

The development command esp_ajax:js_term() reads the .js scripts in this 
folder and converts them to .js.src files which are erlang terms. These terms 
have element ids and label parameters encoded as atoms; All other javascript 
code is converted to "minified" and binary form for efficient transmission.

The .js.src term files are used to create the esp_ajax module.
